# Understanding the vaccine stance of Italian tweets

Social media is often used to express opinions and attitudes toward vaccines.
I worked on a project for research hospital OPBG (https://www.ospedalebambinogesu.it/) studying vaccine related tweets.
In July 2022 we published our findings

With the recent advances in AI models, I thought to revist some of the data.

Claude.ai Opus4.6 produced a analysis and dashboard, blowing me away with the insights and accessibility of the findings.
